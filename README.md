# Auralyx
Auralyx is an open-source music player application built with React Native and the Spotify API. It aims to provide a seamless music listening experience with an intuitive interface and robust features.

## Getting Started
To get started with Auralyx, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm or Yarn
- React Native CLI
- Android Studio (for Android) or Xcode (for iOS)
- A Spotify Developer account and app setup (for API access)

## Environment Setup
Complete the React Native - Environment Setup instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

## Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auralyx.git
cd auralyx

## Install dependencies:

```bash
### using npm
npm install

### OR using Yarn
yarn install
```
## Running the App
## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

### using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
